                           PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, 
                           and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles
                            a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, 
                            we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</br></br>
                            In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of 
                            organizations that *get* design, both large and small. 
                            He will share what those teams, departments, 
                            and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, 
                            how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. 
                            Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost 
                            impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                             a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, 
                             we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</br></br>
                             In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of 
                             organizations that *get* design, both large and small. 
                             He will share what those teams, departments, 
                             and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, 
                             how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. 
                             Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost 
                             impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
